## Hotel booking demand dataset

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

#### Importing libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
### View Basic Attributes of Data

#### 1. View first 5 rows of data

```{r hotel_bookings}
hotel_bookings = read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")
head(hotel_bookings)
```
#### 2. How many rows of data and how many variables?

```{r}
variables <- ncol(hotel_bookings)
rows <- nrow(hotel_bookings)
```
There are 32 variables with 119390 rows in this dataset. It looks like there are a lot of categorical variables in this dataset mixed with dates as well. An interesting metric they keep track of is number of special requests. Who knew hotels/resorts kept track of such things.

#### 3. What is the data range for reservations?

```{r}
min_res_date <- min(hotel_bookings$reservation_status_date)
max_res_date <- max(hotel_bookings$reservation_status_date)
```
It appears that this data spans from 2014-10-17 to 2017-09-14.

#### 4. Data type of each columns?

```{r}
glimpse(hotel_bookings)
```

### Data Wrangling
#### Dropping the columns with missing values.
```{r}
drop <- c("company","agent")
hotel_bookings = hotel_bookings[,!(names(hotel_bookings) %in% drop)]
```
#### Adding canceled as a categorical variable
```{r}
hotel_bookings$canceled <- hotel_bookings$is_canceled == 1
```

### Data Visualizations (EDA):
Lets explore the data with a couple of visualizations that will answer some interesting questions.

#### 1. What is the percentage of cancelled booking of each type of hotels?
```{r}
hotel_bookings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= hotel, fill=canceled))+
  theme_set(theme_light()) +
  geom_bar(alpha=0.8, position = "dodge", width=0.5)+
  labs(title= "No. of cancelations with each hotel type", x= "Hotel Type", y="No. of Cancelations", fill="Canceled") + scale_fill_discrete(name = "is_canceled", labels = c("confirmed", "canceled")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(vjust=.5))

```

#### 2. Distribution of the cancelation during different months of the year.

```{r}
ggplot(hotel_bookings, aes(x = arrival_date_month, fill = canceled)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", alpha=0.8) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits= month.name) +
  theme_set(theme_light()) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=.9)) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "is_canceled", labels = c("confirmed", "canceled")) +
  labs(title= "Cancelation in different months of the year", x='Reservation Month', y='Frequency') +
  facet_wrap(~hotel)

```


#### 3. The market segments and cancelations
```{r}
hotel_bookings$canceled <- hotel_bookings$is_canceled == 1
hotel_bookings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = market_segment, fill = canceled)) + 
  theme_set(theme_light()) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=.5)) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "is_canceled", labels = c("confirmed", "canceled")) +
  labs(title= "The market segments and cancelations", x='Market Segment', y='Count')
  
```

#### 4. Analyzing canceled booking based on deposit_type.
```{r}
ggplot(hotel_bookings, aes(x = deposit_type, fill=canceled)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", width=0.5) +
  theme_light() + scale_fill_discrete(name = "is_canceled", labels = c("confirmed", "canceled"))
```

#### 5.Visualisation of lead_time.
```{r}
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
subset <- hotel_bookings  %>% 
  mutate(lead_time_binned=round(lead_time / 20) * 20)  %>% 
  group_by(lead_time_binned)  %>% 
  summarise(cancellation_rate=mean(is_canceled)) %>% 
  select(lead_time_binned, cancellation_rate)

ggplot(data= subset) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=lead_time_binned, y=cancellation_rate, color='#eb5505'), show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlab('Lead time') + ylab('Cancellation rate') +
  labs(title= "Relations b/w lead_time mean and cancelation ratio")

```
